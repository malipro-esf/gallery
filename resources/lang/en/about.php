    'about' => "My father loved art and was an avid reader. At one time, he even owned a bookstore. With his encouragement and support,
I started drawing with colored pencils at the age of 12. Sometimes I would melt solid oil, apply it on paper, and after it dried,
I would copy my design.

In the summer of 2004, I attended an oil painting class and painted several landscape paintings. One day, my father looked at my paintings and said, 'Maryam, your paintings are beautiful, but the perspective is weak.'

Later, I realized that my father was talking about the Impressionist style and enjoyed the effect of colors in their most contrasting states. Like myself, he did not prefer the Realist style.

For four years, I experienced depression due to changes in my life. During this time, with my father's help, I built my own painting gallery. During this period, I only went out with friends, exercised, and went on outings to rebuild my spirit, and then I started painting again.

Gradually, I took on students and began working in several other teaching institutions. Alongside teaching, I learned the Impressionist and alla prima styles from Master Sajad Khalagh. Subsequently, I participated in several international and domestic exhibitions, received reputable certificates, and won the title of selected artwork at two international exhibitions, Peace and Lady of Nowruz.

My work transitioned from Realism to alla prima and conceptual and thematic pieces. I was able to hold a solo exhibition titled Peace and Women's Harm. With a high school diploma, I became an art teacher at the non-profit Sama School. In 2017, I went to university to study graphic painting. Although I was accepted into the directing and editing program at Tehran University in 2007, I did not attend at that time.

In summary, at the end of my academic year, I made a strong start in mural painting by painting the university café's wall. However, my mural painting journey had actually started in 2013 at a kindergarten, but not in a specialized manner.

Since 2019, I became a painting and beautification contractor for the municipality and painted many walls. I worked on cafés, children's and teenagers' rooms, beauty salons, and more. My mural and easel paintings progressed simultaneously to the point where I painted walls by day and canvases by night, transforming copied works into original ones and forming a new mindset about color."
